Welcome to eventfield C# ASP.NET MVC 3 Event Calendar *********************************************************************************************************************IntroductionThis is a simple event calendar that allows a user to browse events, buy tickets and checkout. In this application, visitors can browse events by Category. They can view a single event and add it to their cart.They can review their cart, removing any items they no longer want. Proceeding to checkout will prompt them to loginor register for a user account. After creating an account, they can complete the order by filling out shipping and payment information. To keep things simple, we're running an amazing promotion: everything is free if they enter promotion code "FREE"! After ordering, they see a simple confirmation screen.In addition to customer-facing pages, I built an administrator section that shows a list of events from which the Administrators can Create, Edit, and Delete events.Technologies involved include JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, C# ASP.NET, SQL Server. The development environmentis Visual Web Developer Express Edition 2010 like a component of Visual Studio.NET 2010. MVC 3 framework has been applied and a package like NuGet was installed.The App folder contains the project demo including all the resources. Note that the current installation of Event Calendar is on my local machine. Therefore changes have to be done to make it run on another machine. My current effort is to improve the program further.Getting Help**********************************************************************************************************************If you have a question or need help with eventfield event calendar, you can get help from the following sources:* eMail: finbrein@gmail.com* IRC: irc://irc.freenode.net #OpenMRS (my nickname is finbrein)
